HTML was said to be the easiest one ,it's somehow .. but when you are a beginner.. i dont think that will still going through your head.. because html is just like the door to every programmer.. because, inorder to design or code something.... there must be an htmml file created... more especially the arrangement was though but finally, i conquered it.</p>

JavaScript is a language i admire so much even due i have not start using it.. because it has some cool functions which can make your website look animated and cool.... but though with the one's i learnt from css.. i could be able to run small stuffs which JavaScript could do.</p>
